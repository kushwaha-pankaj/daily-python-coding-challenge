# Personal coding practice
# Problem: Find a heap using memoization.

```python
def find_heap(n):
    if n < 0:
        return None
    if n <= 1:
        return 1

    memo = [0] * (n + 1)
    memo[0], memo[1] = 1, 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        memo[i] = memo[i - 1] + memo[i - 2] # This is just an example, as actual heap calculation might differ
    return memo[n]
```
